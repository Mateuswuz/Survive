Michael...
You truly do live up to your name.
You remind me of a close friend with a similar name in heaven...
Fitting.
Perhaps, they casted me out for a reason, to allow me experience this...
to get me to snap out of this obsessed rage...
They loved me back home. I see, I... I have a lot of reflecting I need to do.
I'm not the righteous angel I thought I was. All the mess I've done speaks for itself.. *sigh*
